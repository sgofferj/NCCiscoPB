29 NOV 2021 Thanks to @franky-b-ne! In https://github.com/sgofferj/NCCiscoPB/pull/1 he provided an updated version which works with PHP7. Awesome!

11 APR 2019: I wrote this code in 2014 for my home PBX. It's ugly, it accesses the database (which might be subject to change) directly and it has many flaws but it used to work just fine. Unfortunately, since PHP5, many things have changed quite a bit and I haven't been keeping up with the changes. So the code does not work at the moment.
